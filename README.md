# monterey (interactive CLI)

Container for discussions and idea exchanges on project Monterey 

## Executive summary

This document describes the tool that expands the current [Redwood Command Line Interface](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/cli-commands). It provides the same [benefits](https://github.com/adriatic/monterey/issues/1#issuecomment-774532529) that a screen editor has over the [line editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_editor). Rather than being a comprehensive definition, this document consists of several sketches of the GUI illustrating the situations where interactive CLI has clear advantages over the current CLI tool. 

Interactive CLI project can be perceived as the first, simplest step in the process of using on VS Code to host Redwood functionality - see [Redwood Outline / Project Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redwoodjs.redwood) for the introduction in that process.

### Important
This document is written before being discussed with [aldonline](https://community.redwoodjs.com/u/aldonline) and his team - see [Announcing the Redwood IDE (VSCode Extension)](https://community.redwoodjs.com/t/announcing-the-redwood-ide-vscode-extension/1236). The improved version will be designed and implemented by the _yet to be defined_ team following RW's implementation practices.
