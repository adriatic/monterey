# monterey (interactive CLI)

Container for discussions and idea exchanges on project Monterey 

## Executive summary

This document describes the tool that expands the current [Redwood Command Line Interface](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/cli-commands). It provides the same [benefits](https://github.com/adriatic/monterey/issues/1#issuecomment-774532529) that a screen editor has over the [line editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_editor). Rather than being a comprehensive definition, his document is not a comprehensive description, it rather consists of several sketches of the GUI illustrating the situations where interactive CLI has clear advantages over the current CLI tool. 

Interactive CLI project can be perceived as the first, simplest step in the process of using on VS Code to host Rewood functionality - see [Redwood Outline / Project Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redwoodjs.redwood) for the introduction in that process.
